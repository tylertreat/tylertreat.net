                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm studying software engineering at Iowa State University and will be graduating in December 2013.
                        I have worked for several software companies with most of my experience being in .NET, Java, and Python,
                        while also contributing to a number of open source projects. After working as a freelance web developer
                        and consultant, I started my own company developing web applications for small businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My expertise primarily lies in J2EE/Spring; however, I also have extensive experience working on the client side
                        with respect to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I build scalable web applications using Google App Engine and related
                        technologies. I've worked largely on Agile and Kanban development teams.

                        I like to lead, but I also like to learn.

                    <p>
                        In my spare time, I build software for Android, including my open source application framework

                        primarily with Python on Google App Engine. Scalability is a key focus.

                        and building web and mobile apps with rich user experiences.

                        ASP.NET, NHibernate, Spring.NET, Spring Batch, and jQuery.

                <p>
                    The majority of my time at Iowa State has been spent on practical aspects of software engineering, such as analysis of algorithms and data structures, software architecture, and collaborative group projects. I have found that working professionally has been an advantageous parallel to taking classes as I've been able to apply what I've learned in the workplace while doing the same in school. Below is a brief overview of some of my academic projects.

                    <p>
                        My senior design project is an Android application for 3M which allows healthcare professionals to connect
                        multiple Bluetooth stethoscopes to a tablet or mobile device. With Listen-In, clinical educators can share 
                        sound simultaneously with several students and leverage tools to aid in diagnosis, including a phonocardiograph.

                    <p>
                        This project involved developing a framework for real-time document syncing to be used in distributed 
                        applications. In this context, a document is any structured piece of data, and intended use cases
                        include a collaborative whiteboard, text editor, and music composer. The system was built on top of ZeroMQ.

                        For a software engineering course, I led a team of developers to build a personal organizer for the Android platform called PlanDroid. The application allows users to manage their to-do list, calendar, and documents all from one place and on-the-go. Nearly 22,000 people have downloaded PlanDroid from Google Play.
